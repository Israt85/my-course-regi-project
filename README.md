My at least 3 project features:
1.If users click the select button they can see the course name in the cart.
2.Clicking select they'll also saw the remaining hours and total credit hour.
3.If users click the select button for add more course they can't add 1 course more than 1 times.


.Discussing how I managed the state in my assingment project
=> I use useState hook 4 times.firstly, I use useState in the Courses folder for load data and map the Courses. and then app folder I use 3 times for adding Cart and set in their, total remaining hour, and total credit hour and set in there. and use useEffect 1 time for load the data from json folder.
